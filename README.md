Within the F1App forlder you will find an exe file for running and using the program, and then any python modules that were also used
Be aware that anytime the program is run, it charges my personal openAI credit fund so please test fullty but not excessivly

The program features two main files. A python file, and a kv (kivy), file. All logic takes place within the python file and all gui and parameter setting 
takes place within the kv file. These two files work incredibly closely with one aother in order to each change depending heavily on the other.
